***Patient Sync*** 
**Problem**: People research their health concerns before calling their doctors. However, the research is time-consuming and annoying because people need to manually filter out all the irrelevant information from pages of Google search results and try to digest all the unintelligible terminologies in the articles/papers. (I wrote this as placeholder. feel free to edit it)
**Solution**: Based on patients' prompt, the chatbot will use plain English to explain the possible causes and provide options to solve/investigate the medical needs. Our differentiators are that (1) the chatbot will give responses based on patients' health history and other health concerns (if patients are willing to provide) (2) we will train the bot with medical research database (such as PubMed) as one of the main source of information.
**Monetization plan**: Charge for advertisement placement from pharmaceuticals, healthcare device providers, or healthcare providers who are eager to gain market share for their new medications, devices or services. The chatbot will be free to use for patients and the ads will be displayed based on keywords from patients' health history and medical concerns.
